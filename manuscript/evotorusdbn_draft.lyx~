\begin_layout Title
A pairwise evolutionary model of protein sequence and structural conformation
 D6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
We give a generative evolutionary model of protein sequence and structural
 conformation.
 Recently, there have been stochastic models of structural evolution, which
 have shown that the inclusion of structural information leads to more reliable
 estimation of evolutionary parameters.
 We introduce a new pairwise evolutionary model which takes into account
 local dependencies between sequence and structural evolution.
 We treat each protein in a pair as random walk in space through the use
 of angular conformations.
 A coupling in our model is such that an amino acid change can lead to a
 jump in angle conformation and a change in diffusion process.
 This model is comparatively more realistic than previous stochastic models,
 since it allows improved understanding of the relationship between sequence
 and structure evolution.
 The generative nature of our model allows us to provide evidence of it's
 validity.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recently it has been realised that one can make a joint stochastic model
 of evolution which takes into account simultaneous alignment of protein
 sequence and 3D structure (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "challis2012stochastic,herman2014simultaneous"

\end_inset

).
 These papers also point out limitations of earlier non-probabilistic methods,
 as well as the benefits of simultaneously taking protein sequence and 3D
 structure into account.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We present a pairwise model which takes into account local dependencies
 between sequence and structural evolution, providing more realism; this
 is a departure from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "challis2012stochastic,herman2014simultaneous"

\end_inset

.
 We treat each protein in a pair as a random walk in space, through the
 use of the phi and psi dihedral angle representations.
 This bypasses the need for structural alignment, unlike in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand nocite
key "challis2012stochastic,herman2014simultaneous"

\end_inset

.
 We use a stochastic diffusion process on phi and psi dihedral angles (See
 December abstract Eduardo), as well as the TKF92 model of insertion and
 deletion.
 We introduce a coupling in our model such that an amino acid change can
 lead to a jump in the phi and psi dihedral angles and a change in diffusion
 process.

Dihedral angle representation.
 A very small section of the protein backbone is displayed in atomic detail:
 each amino acid contains four backbone atoms (

 The side chain is represented by one pseudo-atom (

 The dihedral angles

 This gives a chemical representation of a typical amino acid.

NEED TO COMMENT ON 2014.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both the 2012 (Challis and Schmidler) and 2014 (Herman and Schmidler) papers
 use the TKF92 model together with OU diffusions, but on atomic coordinates
 of C-alpha atoms rather than on dihedral angles, as in our model.
 Overall, we have various modelling virtues that provide more realism than
 the 2012 and 2014 papers.
 Our model has the potential for extension to the full phylogeny, rather
 than just pairs of proteins as we have considered in the current work.

 Each observation, 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{a}^{i}$

 An observation corresponding to a particular protein at aligned site

Each hidden node

 in the alignment 
\begin_inset Formula $M$

 Initially we treat the alignment

\end_inset

 as given apriori, but later on modify the HMM to allow an unknown alignment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model is parametrised by 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 hidden states.
 Every hidden node, 
\begin_inset Formula $H^{i}$
\end_inset

, corresponding to an aligned site 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 takes an integer value from 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 for the hidden state at node 
\begin_inset Formula $H^{i}$
\end_inset

 Furthermore, every hidden state couples together an evolutionary regime
 pair 
\begin_inset Formula $(r_{a}^{i}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $r_{b}^{i})$
\end_inset

, written as 
\begin_inset Formula $H^{i}(r_{a}^{i},r_{b}^{i}).$
\end_inset

 Each evolutionary regime takes on integer values 1 or 2, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $(r_{a}^{i},r_{b}^{i})\in\{1,2\}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $4q$
\end_inset

 possible combinations of hidden state and evolutionary regime pairs at
 every aligned site 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 We will return the role of the evolutionary regime pairs later.
 
\end_layout

From this point forward we may sometimes write 
\begin_inset Formula $H^{i}(r_{a}^{i},r_{b}^{i})$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $H^{i}$
\end_inset

 We write 
\begin_inset Formula $H=(H^{1},H^{2},\ldots,H^{m}$

We now turn to the meaning of the evolutionary regimes.
 Two modes of evolution are modelled:

\end_inset

Constant evolution
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jump evolution
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Constant evolution occurs when the evolutionary regime starting in protein

\begin_inset Formula $r_{a}^{i}=r_{b}^{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Conversely, jump evolution occurs when the evolutionary regime starting
 in protein 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $r_{a}^{i}$
\end_inset

, differs from the evolutionary regime ending in protein

\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{a}^{i}\neq r_{b}^{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Constant evolution in our model, is intended to capture structural drift
 (changes in diheral angles restricted to a region of the Ramachandran plot),
 whereas jump evolution allows us to capture structural shift (large changes
 in dihedral angles, possibly between distant regions of the Ramachandran
 plot).

 Furthermore, it is no longer necessary to consider the unobserved evolutionary
 trajectory linking the two observations and hence there is no need to marginali
se over all possible trajectories, as in a model with continuous Markovian
 switching between evolution regimes.
 This allows us to model structural drift in a computationally tractable
 manner.
 Our jump model can be justified by noting that in the case where

 evolutionary regimes, ensures overall time-reversibility in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:joint_likelihood"

\end_inset

.
 This allows to treat the phylogenetic tree relating proteins 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{a}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{b}$
\end_inset

 as unrooted, implying we can arbitarily pick 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{a}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{b}$
\end_inset

 as a root of the phylogenetic tree (CITE).
 This avoids the need to marginalise over the common ancestor protein of
 proteins 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{b}$
\end_inset

 and branch times.
 Note that whilst time-reversibility of the evolutionary processes at each
 site holds, this is different from time-reversibility of the HMM.
 The HMM is specified by a non-reversible transition probability matrix,
 implying different probabilities going in opposite directions along a pair
 of proteins (N to C terminus vs.
 C to N terminus).

Stochastic processes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each evolutionary regime couples together three time-reversible stochastic
 processes that each seperately describe the evolution of the three pairs
 of observation types, as in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:likelihood2"

\end_inset

.
 Because each evolutionary regime is intended to capture different features
 of sequence and structural evolution, a different set of parameters is
 used to describe each.
 Parameters that correspond to a particular evolutionary regime are termed
 'regime-specific', whereas parameters that are shared across all evolutionary
 regimes are termed 'global'.

Amino acid evolution

Amino acid evolution is described by a Continous-Time Markov Chains (CTMC),

\begin_layout Standard
Amino acid evolution in our model is parameterised in the following way:
 the exchangeability of amino acids is described by a

\end_inset

 symmetric global exchangeability matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 (190 free parameters; Whelan and Goldman (2001)), a regime-specific set
 of 20 amino acid equilibrium frequencies 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{r}^{h}=\text{diag}\{\pi_{1},\pi_{2},\ldots,\pi_{20}\}$
\end_inset

 (19 free parameters per evolutionary regime), and a regime-specific scaling
 factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{r}^{h}$
\end_inset

 (1 free parameter per evolutionary regime).
 Together these define a regime-specific amino acid rate matrix

\begin_layout Subsection
Accounting for alignment uncertainty
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Protein sequences can not only undergo point mutation events, but also also
 insertion and deletion events.
 We describe a modified pairwise TKF92 alignment HMM that models both local
 sequence/structure evolution and sequence alignment.
 Whilst, it is possible to fix the alignment in advance by pre-aligning
 the sequences using one of the many available optimisation-based alignment
 methods (CITE CITE), doing so ignores alignment uncertainty.
 An alignment can be thought of as a statement about homology, such that
 when amino acid positions are aligned in order to indicate homology they
 are considered to have evolved solely via mutation along the evolutionary
 trajectory linking them and not via insertion or deletion.
 As the sequence of insertion and deletions is rarely observed in practice,
 it is difficult to make statements about the true underlying alignment
 (homology relationships), especially when the sequences being compared
 are distantly related and/or the rate of evolution is high.
 The TKF92 model [CITE CITE] suitably provides a stochastic process describing
 the evolution of insertions and deletions.
 [DESCRIBE PROCESS IN MORE DETAIL]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the pairwise case, the TKF92 model can be represented as an HMM - we
 use the TKF92 HMM described in [CITE] with the modification that each emitted
 pair of characters is drawn from one of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 evolutionary hidden states (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:alignmenthmm"

\end_inset

).
 This HMM formulation allows one to integrate over all possible pairwise
 alignments in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(nm)$
\end_inset

 time, where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 are the respective lengths of the two sequences.
 The introduction of evolutionary hidden states increases this complexity
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(nmH)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is the number of evolutionary hidden states.
 The probability of transitioning from one evolutionary hidden state from
 one alignment position to the next is given by the probability transition
 matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $p(h^{i},h^{i+1})$
\end_inset

, which is intended to encode the local sequence/structure evolution as
 in the TorusDBN model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The likelihood of a sequence pair is given by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p(O|t_{ab},\Theta,\Omega)=\underset{A,H}{\sum}p(O|A,H,t_{ab},\Theta)p(A,H|t_{ab},\Omega)\label{eq:pair_likelihood}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 is the alignment and hidden state transition parameters, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{ab}$
\end_inset

 is the time separating the two sequences 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the evolutionary parameters.
 The sum over alignments and hidden states (
\begin_inset Formula $\underset{A,H}{\sum}$
\end_inset

) can be computed using the forward algorithm.

\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p(O_{a}^{i},O_{b}^{i}|h^{i},t_{ab})=\begin{cases}
p(O_{a}^{i},O_{b}^{i}|H^{i},t_{ab}) & \text{ are matched are homologous (homologous)}\\
p(O_{a}^{i}|H^{i}) & \text{if the observation in sequence \ensuremath{a}is the result of an indel. }\\
p(O_{b}^{i}|H^{i}) & \text{if the observation in sequence \ensuremath{b}is the result of an indel. }
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that in the case of insertion or deletion the probability of observing
 a single observation is no longer dependent on the time parameter as it
 is assumed that the observations are drawn from the stationary distribution.

\begin_layout Standard
For reasons of tractability we have chosen a similar HMM framework for our
 pairwise evolutionary model, although more general frameworks such as Factorial
 HMMs, that allow additional hidden layers, or Continous Time Bayesian Networks,
 that allow hidden states that evolve between protein as well as capturing
 dependencies along the proteins, could also be considered.
